\section{Inventory}
\textbf{Components:}\begin{itemize}
  \item Raw materials
  \item Works in progress
  \item Finished Goods
\end{itemize}
The Goals is to minimize amount of cash tied up in Inventory
\textbf{Tools to minimize:}\begin{itemize}
  \item Just-in-time
  \item As the firm increases its order size, the number of orders falls and therefore the order costs decline
  \item However, an increase in order size also increases the average amount in inventory, so that the carrying cost of inventory rises
  \item The trick is to strike a balance between these two costs
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Economic Order Qty:} Order size that minimizes total inventory costs (generally applicable formula
with some limitations)
\[EOQ = \sqrt{2*Sales*\frac{CostPerOrder}{CarryingCost}}\]
\textbf{Trade Credit:}receivables from one company to another\\
\textbf{Consumer Credit:}receivables from consumers\\
\[Credit Decision = prob. * PV(COST-REV) - (1-prob.) * PV(COST)\]

\section{Mergers}
\textbf{Horizontaml Merger:} One that takes place between two firms
in the same line of business
\textbf{Vertical Merger:} Involves companies at different stages of production
\textbf{Congomlerate Merger:} Involves companies in unrelated lines of business
\textbf{Economies of Scale:} Reduce per-unit cost through spreading fixed cost across more units
\textbf{Economies of Vertical Integration:} Control over suppliers may reduce cost - overintegration can have opposite effect
\textbf{Complementary Resources:} Merging may result in each firm filling in the “missing pieces” of its firm with pieces from the other firm
\textbf{Industry Consolidation:} These conditions typically lead to mergers and acquisitions, prompting cuts in capacity and jobs, and freeing up capital for reinvestment elsewhere in the economy
\textbf{Diversification:} Diversification is easier and cheaper for the stockholder than for the corporation. There is little evidence that investors pay a premium for diversified firms
\textbf{Increasing Earnings per Share (BootsTrap Game):} Acquiring firm has high P/E ratio, Selling firm has low P/E ratio, After merger, acquiring firm has short-term EPS rise, Long term, acquirer will have slower than normal EPS growth due to share dilution 
\textbf{Lower Borrowing Cost:} There might be economies of scale, e.g., if firms can make fewer, larger security issues by merging, there can be savings
\textbf{Management Motives:} Manager hubris, Personal objectives (salary, reputation...), Unusual self-esteem leads to more frequent and larger acquisitions, higher premiums paid, value destroying mergers
\[PV(AB) > PV(A) + PV(B)\]
