\section*{Formulas}
\subsection{Put-Call-Parity}
    \[
C + PV(EX) = P + S
\]

\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $C$ = Price of the European call option
  \item $PV(EX)$ = Present value of the strike price = $\frac{Ex.Price}{(1+r)}$
  \item $P$ = Price of a European Put
  \item $S$ = Share Price
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Option $\Delta$}
\[Option \Delta = \frac{C_u - C_d}{S_u - S_d} = \frac{P_u - P_d}{S_u - S_d}\]
\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $C_u$ = Call upside
  \item $C_d$ = Call downside
  \item $P$ = Put
  \item $S$ = Stock
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Risk neutral probability of rising value}
\[p^{*} = \frac{(1+r) - d}{u-d}\]
\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $r$ = Interest rate
  \item $d$ = Relative downward change
  \item $u$ = Relative upward change
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Expected Value}
\[Expected Value = (p^{*} * PayOff_u) + ([1 - p^{*}] * PayOff_d)\]
\subsection{Present Value}
\[Present Value = \frac{Expected Value}{(1+r)} = ValueShares - ValueLoan\]
\[Value Loan = \frac{ValueShares_d}{(1+r)}\]
\subsection{Up and Down Changes}
\[1 + UpsideChange = u = e^{\sigma*\sqrt{h}}\]
\[1 + DownsideChange = d = \frac{1}{u}\]
\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\sigma$ = Standard Deviation
  \item $h$ = Fraction of Year
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Black-Scholes Formula(weg wenn zu viel)}
\[C = (N[d_1] * S) - (N[d_2] * PV[EX])\]
\[d_1 = \frac{log(\frac{S}{PV[EX]})}{\sigma *\sqrt{t}} + \frac{\sigma\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
\[d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{t}\]
\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $C$ = Call Value
  \item $N[d]$ = Cummulative normal probability
  \item $PV(EX)$ = Ex. Price at risk-free interest rate
  \item $S$ = Stock price
  \item $t$ = number of periods tp exercise date
  \item $\sigma$ = Standard Deviation 
  \item $if d_1 is large, N(d_1) is close to 1.0$
  \item $if d_1 is zero, N(d_1) is close to 0.5$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Present Value Formlua BOND}
\[PV = \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{cpn}{(1+r)^{t}}+\frac{par}{(1+r)^{T}}\]
\[Promised Yield = \frac{Payoff}{PV} - 1\]
\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $cpn$ = Coupon rate
  \item $r$ = Interest rate
  \item $T$ = Number of periods
  \item $par$ = Face value
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Predicting Default: Altman's Z-score}
\[Z = 1.2x_1 + 1.4x_2 + 3.3x_3 + 0.6x_4 + 1.0x_5\]
\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $x_1$ = working capital/total assets
  \item $x_2$ = retained earnings/total assets
  \item $x_3$ = earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)/total assets
  \item $x_4$ = market value of equity / total liabilities
  \item $x_5$ = sales/total assets
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Convertible Securities}
\[Conversion Price = \frac{Face Value (1000\$)}{Conversion Ratio}\]
\[Conversion Value = Conversion ratio * share price\]
\section{Take or Die}
\textbf{Expansion Options}: Uncertainty $\uparrow$ - Valoue of exp. option $\uparrow$
\textbf{Value of a call (takeaways)}: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Never worth more than the stock price itself.
  \item When the share is worthless, the option is worthless.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Lease or Buy}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Buy if equivalent annual cost of ownership and operation is less than the best lease rate
  \item For using extended periods, buying tends to be cheaper
  \item Leasing, because lessor might be able to manage asset at less expense than lessee
  \item Leasing has useful options in leasing agreement
\end{itemize}
\[NPV_{lease} = InitialFinancing - \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{LeaseCashFlow}{[1 + r_D * (1-T_c)]^t}\]
\[NPV = PV_{EquivalentLoan} + InitialFinancing\]
\begin{itemize}
  \item $r_D$ = discount rate
  \item $t_c$ = marginal tax rate
\end{itemize}
\section*{Managing Risks}
\textbf{Risks to a business:} Cash shortfalls, Financial distress, Agency costs, Currency fluctuations, Political instability, Weather changes
\section*{Pricing Futures Contracts}
\[F_t = S_0 * (1 + r_f - y)^t \]
\[= S_0 * (1 + StorageCost - CY)^t\]
\[NCY = ConvenienceYield - StorageCost\]
\begin{itemize}
  \item $F_t$ = future price on contract of $t$ length
  \item $S_0$ = today's spot price
  \item $r_f$ = risk-free interest rate
  \item $y$ = dividend yield 
  \item $NCY$ = NetConvenienceYield
\end{itemize}
\section*{Hedging Rations and Basis Risk}
\[ExpectedChangeInValueA = \alpha + \delta * (ChangInValueB)\]
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\delta$ = sensitivity of A to change in the value of B (hedge ration)
  \item $\alpha$ = offset
\end{itemize}
\section*{Premium- Discount Relationship}
\[ForwardDiscount = \frac{1}{t_{years}} * (\frac{SpotPrice}{ForwardRate} - 1)\]
